         <h1>The relevance of George Orwell today; Standing up for democracy and against fascism</h1>
         <h3>George Orwell’s influence as a writer has grown since his death in 1950 at the age of 46, particularly in recent decades. He was unashamedly a voice on the left – independent minded, an iconoclast and unafraid to stand against the hypocrisies and tyrannies of both his own side, as well as of the right.</h3>
         <p><span class="lead-in">In today’s challenging world</span> – from climate change to the war in Ukraine and rise of despotism, demagoguery and a nascent fascism from Russia to the US, not to forget our own domestics and Boris Johnson’s degenerate Toryism – Orwell provides a powerful example of a moral compass and the importance of principle.</p>
         <p>Last Saturday I had the rare privilege and opportunity to have a two-hour public conversation with Orwell’s adopted son Richard Blair in Garnethill Multicultural Centre, Glasgow.</p>
         <p>Blair had a difficult childhood. He was born in May 1944 and adopted by Orwell and his wife Eileen as a baby. Eileen subsequently died in March 1945; Orwell married again in October 1949 to Sonia, and then died three months later in January 1950 leaving Blair to be brought up by Orwell’s sister Avril. After school in Scotland and England, Richard went on to have a career in industry before upon retirement setting up The Orwell Society, as well as being a patron of The Orwell Foundation and the prestigious Orwell Prize.</p>
         <p>Richard Blair remembers his father well, even though he was taken from him when he was five and a half years. He recalls a man with many qualities and contradictions, who loved ‘telling me stories, with a clarity of thought knowing that simple words can convey a deep meaning.’ Orwell had a vivid sense of humour and deep love of the outdoors, animals and gardening. Central to this and Blair’s memories are Barnhill Farm on the island of Jura – owned then as it is now by the Fletcher family – where he and his father spent much time from the summer of 1946 onward. Blair reminisced about spending time there with his father, saying it was ‘a wonderful place for children. You could open your front door and you are free’. He recounted memories such as when their car broke down on the way from Jura to Glasgow, or the time their dinghy sank whilst they were navigating the Corrievreckan whirlpool and they had to take refuge on a nearby island. This became a story at the time in the Scottish Daily Express – with Blair adding ‘just in case anyone didn’t think it was true.’</p>
         <p>This process can be traced back to 1980s financial deregulation, which sparked a dramatic increase in lending: household debt rose from 80 percent of household incomes in 1980 to 150 percent in 2008. Much of this was mortgage lending, which increased twentyfold between 1997 and 2008. During this period, the UK gained the dubious honor of having the highest proportional level of mortgage lending of any major economy. As a result of deregulation, banks did not have to cover these loans with existing deposits, so the loans that they created effectively increased the money supply. With all this new cash chasing the same amount of assets, house prices were bound to increase.</p>
         <p>The lending boom of the pre-crisis period turned housing from a basic consumer good into a speculative asset. Capital from around the world flooded into the UK property market, allowing banks to extend even more credit. The process through which mortgages were securitized — turned into commodities that could be traded on financial markets — allowed banks to make yet more loans.</p>
         <p>Usually, when we tell this story, we focus on the moment the music stopped in 2007, when house prices collapsed. But UK house prices have more than recovered — in fact, they hit a record high in July. Why? Because the financial architecture of the economy remains fundamentally the same.</p>
         <p>There are measures that can be mobilized to counter this. In a recent report for the Institute for Public Policy Research, I argued that the Bank of England should have a house price inflation target that would limit the amount banks were able to lend for housing purchases, and especially for those seeking to buy second homes. The taxation of housing also needs to be reformed: a land-value tax would be a start, but inheritance tax also needs to be increased and the loopholes closed to ensure the system captures the huge capital gains of the past forty years.</p>
         <p>But foreign, speculative investment in housing remains a serious problem that can’t be solved by building more housing or limiting lending alone. To tackle it, we must limit capital flows into the UK. A currency-transactions tax would make a serious contribution to this, acting as a form of qualitative capital control to help to limit flows of hot money into our housing market. A New Zealand-style law placing restrictions on foreign ownership wouldn’t be a bad idea either.</p>
         <p>The next Labour government must restore housing to its proper place: as a human right rather than a speculative asset. It’s time to take on the international financial elites who have made London their playground.</p>
